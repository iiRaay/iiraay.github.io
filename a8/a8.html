<b>Everyday the Same Dream</b><br>

Scenarios:<br>
There seems to be 5 scenarios:<br>
	1. Have a regular day by waking up, putting clothes on, exit the house, go into elevator, talk to lady, leave elevator, go to car and to the right, continue walking right, arrive at office and talk to boss then go into cubicle to work.<br>
	2. repeat all of step 1 up until you talk to the boss. At this point, keep going right onto the terrance and keep going right until we have the option to jump and suicide.
	3. repeat all steps until exit the elevator. We go left now instead of right and talk to the homeless person when we see. We then appear at a graveyard. The lady in elevator also has updated interactions next run.<br>
	4. Repeat all steps until get into the car from day 1 then we exit the car and go left. At the cow, pet it  and go back to the car to the office into the cubicle. The lady also has updated interactions here.<br>
	5. Exit the house without doing anything and go to the boss. After this, there should be noone and we should be able to go to the terrance and see that everyone has been fired and we see one last guy jump off the terrance.<br>
<br><br>
<b>1. How does the allowed interaction keep the narrative on track? How does it permit variations and branches?</b><br>
	The interaction keeps the narrative on track very well because it will keep looping until we have completed the correct steps. This matches in with the game title and intent of the authors because it seems like they want to show us that we live the same life everyday unless we change it ourselves with various decisions. This interaction also allows the game to effectively branch off into different game states. As each flag is triggered, a different game state is triggered which allows the game to flow with ease.<br>

<b>2. Describe the nature of the graphical quality and how it is relevant to the story. </b><br>
	The nature of the graphical quality fits in and suits the relevant story because it allows the user to very easily relate and empathize with the character they are playing. Keeping the graphics and characters simple like this allows the user to pretend that they are that character or feel for them since it is very easy to visualize yourself in the game's state due to the simplicity of the graphics and environment. We are all familiar with all the objects and landscape that occurs in this game. This is especially relevant to the story since this story was created to show the everyday life of a businessman and how it will turn out if nothing is done - this is conveying a message to the player.<br>

<b>3. Describe the nature of the interaction and how it influences choices and how the player feels.</b><br>
	The nature of the interaction is very good for what it is trying to accomplish. The interaction has very simple controls which allow players to instantly pick up the game and start playing through the story. It also allows the user to very simply influence the character to do an action or simply walk past it which in turn allows the player to feel like they are the person who is in the game.<br>
