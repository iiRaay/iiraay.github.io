									<h3>Who is Frédéric François Chopin?</h3>
									<p>Frédéric Chopin was a child prodigy born in Poland who later then settled in France. His career as a composer and pianist of the romantic era first began when he published his first composition at the age of 7 which lead him to perform on stage one year later.</p>
									<p>Throughout his career, Chopin hated public performances and only performed 30 public concerts. In addition to his concerts, he composed some of the greatest piano pieces of the era (<a href="http://www.pianosociety.com/pages/chopinworks/">a full list can be found here</a>) which encapsulated a wide variety of genres including preludes, nocturnes, waltzes, sonatas, and etudes.</p>
